User Tutorials
--------------

Here we provide a number of tutorials, presented in increasing complexity, designed to walk through the use of Autocnet.
Some of the data is stored remotely (due to the size).  In these cases the tutorial provides links to download the data.
All tutorials are rendered in plain text in the documentation, but are available for interactive use by cloning our github
repository from the Astrogeology Science Center's `gitlab <https://code.usgs.gov/astrogeology/autocnet>`_.
